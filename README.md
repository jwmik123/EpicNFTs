# Smart Contract and NFT minting test project


Solidity, Javascript, hardhat, zeppelin, alchemy, Rinkeby.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Steps for creating a NFT project

- Solidity Smart Contract
- run & deploy script with Javascript
- Create an Alchemy account
- Create an Ethereum wallet

#### The above will also automatically create a collection in Opensea
